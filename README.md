## Project Name
Recursive Factorial
## About
This project implements a recursive function to compute the factorial of a non-negative integer n (n!). Factorial is the product of all positive integers from 1 to n, with 0! defined as 1. The implementation is in JavaScript and includes test cases to verify the function's correctness.
## Prerequisites
To run this project, you need a JavaScript runtime environment (e.g., Node.js or a browser console) installed on your system.
No additional libraries are required.
## Features
This Recursive Factorial includes these features:

-Recursive function implementation for factorial calculation

-Handles base case (n=0) correctly

-Outputs factorial results for n=0, 4, 5, and 6

-Includes assertions to verify correct factorial outputs

-Simple console-based output using println

## Getting Started & Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

`git clone https://github.com/NickAlvarez20/Recursivefactorial.git`

## Usage
Run the JavaScript script (e.g., factorial.js) in a JavaScript runtime environment, such as Node.js or a browser console:
`node learningRecursion.js`

Alternatively, you can copy and paste the code into a browser's developer console to see the output.

## Learning Outcomes
This project helped me:


-Understand recursion and the importance of base and recursive cases

-Practice implementing mathematical algorithms in JavaScript

-Learn to use assertions for testing function outputs

-Gain familiarity with JavaScript console output and debugging
